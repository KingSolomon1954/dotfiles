# Location is different for pre-installed syntax highlighting files
# between HomeBrew (MacOS) and Linux. And it seems that HomeBrew doesn't
# automatically include their pre-installed syntax highlighting files 
# while Linux does. To share a single nanorc setup between HomeBrew and
# Linux keep a subfolder of all the syntax highlighting files locally.
# Syntax files came from this repo and were copied into highlighters
# subfoldder.
